jQuery Mobile theme with LessCss
================================

This project aims to integrate LessCss with jQuery Mobile base theme as downloaded from [theme roller](http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/ "jQuery Mobile theme rolller").

The project uses [jQuery Mobile version 1.2.0](http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/10/02/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-2-0-final/ "jQuery Mobile version 1.2.0")

Add swatch
----------
If you need to add a swatch (e.g. called <code>f</code>) simply:

1. copy and paste <code>swatch-a.less</code> (inside <code>themes</code> directory) renaming it as <code>swatch-f.less</code>
2. open <code>swatch-f.less</code> with your preferred editor and:
	* search for <code>@a-</code> and change to <code>@f-</code>
	* search for <code>.ui-bar-a</code> and change to <code>.ui-bar-f</code>
	* search for <code>.ui-body-a</code> and change to <code>.ui-body-f</code>
	* search for <code>.ui-btn-up</code> and change to <code>.ui-btn-up-f</code>
	* search for <code>.ui-btn-hover</code> and change to <code>.ui-btn-hover-f</code>
	* search for <code>.ui-btn-down</code> and change to <code>.ui-btn-down-f</code>
3. save <code>swatch-f.less</code>
4. add <code>@import "swatch-f.less";</code> line to <code>app.less</code>
5. compile <code>theme.less</code> to <code>theme.css</code>

Application configuration
-------------------------
File <code>app.less</code> let you import all swatches you need (default: a,b,c,d,e), jQuery Mobile mixins and global variables. Just edit <code>app.less</code>
to import more or less options (e.g. a second mixins file, other swatches of few swatches).

**theme.less** simply imports <code>app.less</code> and it includes css rules for structure.
